                Iâ€™m currently starting in software development by going through a bootcamp at Southern Methodist University where I received my certificate in Full Stack Web Development. In that program I have learned how to create various applications. In that that time I learned the importance of writing readable and maintainable code. I continue to further myself by learning new technologies and improve as a developer in a fast-changing industry.
